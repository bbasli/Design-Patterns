## Introduction

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software engineering problems. They provide a common vocabulary and framework for developers to discuss and implement solutions to common problems. There are three categories of design patterns: creational, structural, and behavioral. 

This repository contains examples of various design patterns in Python, along with explanations of their use cases and benefits.

## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns are used to create objects in a way that is flexible and reusable. They include the following patterns:

* Abstract Factory
* Builder
* Factory Method
* Prototype
* Singleton

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns are used to organize classes and objects into larger structures. They include the following patterns:

* Adapter
* Bridge
* Composite
* Decorator
* Facade
* Flyweight
* Proxy

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are used to manage the interactions and responsibilities of objects. They include the following patterns:

* Chain of Responsibility
* Command
* Interpreter
* Iterator
* Mediator
* Memento
* Observer
* State
* Strategy
* Template Method
* Visitor

## Usage

To use this repository, simply clone it and run the examples in a Python environment. Each design pattern is implemented in its own file, along with comments and explanations of the implementation. 

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you would like to add examples of additional design patterns or improve existing examples, feel free to open a pull request.
